# Image Detecting Code
Made for image segmentation on videos (cars, trucks, buses...). Still being studied and tested

### Objective: 
- Continue studies on that field and apply to agriculture business (grapes, mangos...)
- Export technology to the **Vale do SÃ£o Francisco**, a rich region for producing grapes, wines, mangos, sugar cane, etc.

### Tech:
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
